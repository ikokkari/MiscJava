# MiscJava

Miscellaneous Java examples from the author's courses over the years. Many of these were replaced by better or more interesting examples in the later semesters, and some others turned out to be too complex for the course they were in.

All source code is released under GNU GPL v3. All computer science instructors are welcome to use and adapt these examples for their courses as they see fit.
